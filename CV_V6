    <hr>
    
    <blockquote>With my prior experience in fast-paced, customer fulfillment-focused environment my ability to remain punctual and consistant is proven. Above all else, I hold a strong desire to improve and innovate on my previous work. I always put my best foot forward - and according those that I have worked alongside and for, I am certaintly capable of delivering high-quality customer service, putting a strong emphasis on end-user experience.</blockquote><blockquote>I have been told that I am highly flexible in my approach to problems and thrive when navigating and adapting to new situations. I readily embrace change without complaint, and find it easier to think of solutions than to overthink the problem at hand. I consider myself to be deeply passionate about Computing, I am steadfast in my desire to learn more about it - and intend on specialising into Data Analytics after my tenure of studies at Canterbury Christ Church.</blockquote>
